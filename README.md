I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Physics from Stony Brook University. Working under professor Will Farr, I research black hole mass function cosmology using the most recent public LIGO data. I'm also a regular visitor to the Flatiron Institute, where I am a member of the Gravitational Wave Group at the Center for Computational Astrophysics. I obtained my Bachelors in Astronomy from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2020, where I did research in Galactic supernova distributions under professor Brian Fields. Outside of classes and research, I'm a huge baseball fan and have recently started dabbling in data science in the sport after watching and playing the sport for most of my life.
