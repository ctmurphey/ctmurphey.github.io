I'm an Astronomy PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign looking for exploding stars throughout the universe with Professor Gautham Narayan. This has me working with big data (over 110 TB and growing!) remotely on the Illinois Campus Cluster and has me working closely with collaborators from across the world (from DARK to Hawaii) who study supernova physics and cosmology.

I got my Master's degree in Physics from Stony Brook University with a secondary certicifate in Advanced Data and Computational Science. My Master's thesis (under Professor Will Farr) was about performing Bayesian inference on cosmological expansion using binary black hole (BBH) mergers orders of magnitude faster than current methods employed by LIGO. This work also routinely took me to the Flatiron Institute in Manhattan, where I was a guest researcher.

I obtained my Bachelors in Astronomy from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2020, where I did research in Galactic supernova distributions under Professor Brian Fields.

Outside of classes and research, I'm a huge baseball fan and have made a few different coding projects using the vast amounts of available data in the sport. I've been coding extensively in Python since 2018, mostly in statistical modeling/analysis and data science.
